# Wpf-Calendar-app
Simple calendar app on wpf.

My first application on wpf. In this application, you can read the date and other parameters, look at the calendar, and also make events for certain days. The events are saved to the sqlite database. At launch, the application greets the user and reminds them to view scheduled events.
